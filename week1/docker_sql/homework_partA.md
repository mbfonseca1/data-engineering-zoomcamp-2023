## Question 2. Understanding docker first run 

Run docker with the python:3.9 image in an interactive mode and the entrypoint of bash.
Now check the python modules that are installed ( use pip list). 
How many python packages/modules are installed?

- 1
- 6
- **3 (Answer)**
- 7

### Input
```docker run -it --entrypoint=bash python:3.9```

```root@13b87c1b21b4:/# pip list```

### Output
```
Package    Version
---------- -------
pip        22.0.4
setuptools 58.1.0
wheel      0.38.4

```

# Prepare Postgres

Run Postgres and load data as shown in the videos
We'll use the green taxi trips from January 2019:

```wget https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/green/green_tripdata_2019-01.csv.gz```

You will also need the dataset with zones:

```wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/nyc-tlc/misc/taxi+_zone_lookup.csv```

Download this data and put it into Postgres (with jupyter notebooks or with a pipeline)


## Question 3. Count records 

How many taxi trips were totally made on January 15?

Tip: started and finished on 2019-01-15. 

Remember that `lpep_pickup_datetime` and `lpep_dropoff_datetime` columns are in the format timestamp (date and hour+min+sec) and not in date.

- 20689
- **20530 (Answer)**
- 17630
- 21090

### Query

```SQL
SELECT 	COUNT(*)
FROM 	green_taxi_data
WHERE 	DATE_TRUNC('day', lpep_pickup_datetime) = '2019-01-15' 
	AND DATE_TRUNC('day', lpep_dropoff_datetime) = '2019-01-15'
```

## Question 4. Largest trip for each day

Which was the day with the largest trip distance
Use the pick up time for your calculations.

- 2019-01-18
- 2019-01-28
- **2019-01-15 (Answer)**
- 2019-01-10

### Query

```SQL
SELECT 		DATE_TRUNC('day', lpep_pickup_datetime) as date,
		trip_distance
FROM 		green_taxi_data
ORDER BY 	2 DESC
LIMIT 		1
```

## Question 5. The number of passengers

In 2019-01-01 how many trips had 2 and 3 passengers?
 
- 2: 1282 ; 3: 266
- 2: 1532 ; 3: 126
- **2: 1282 ; 3: 254 (Answer)**
- 2: 1282 ; 3: 274

### Query


```SQL
SELECT 		passenger_count, 
		COUNT(*)
FROM 		green_taxi_data
WHERE 		DATE_TRUNC('day', lpep_pickup_datetime) = '2019-01-01' 
		AND (passenger_count = 2 OR passenger_count = 3) 
GROUP BY 	1
```

## Question 6. Largest tip

For the passengers picked up in the Astoria Zone which was the drop off zone that had the largest tip?
We want the name of the zone, not the id.

Note: it's not a typo, it's `tip` , not `trip`

- Central Park
- Jamaica
- South Ozone Park
- **Long Island City/Queens Plaza (Answer)**


### Query

```SQL
SELECT 		zpu."Zone" as pick_up,
		zdo."Zone" as drop_off,
		gt.tip_amount as tip
FROM 		zones_data zpu,
		zones_data zdo,
		green_taxi_data gt
WHERE 		zpu."LocationID" = gt."PULocationID" 
		AND zdo."LocationID" = gt."DOLocationID"
		AND zpu."Zone" = 'Astoria'
ORDER BY 	3 DESC
LIMIT 		1
```
